Kiwi TCMS is donating € 10000 (ten thousand euro) to our community to enable more hands working
together and give an opportunity for people to get exposed to open source
contributions. You can read more about the rules of the program in
[Round 01]({filename}2020-04-17-bounty-program-part01.markdown)!
