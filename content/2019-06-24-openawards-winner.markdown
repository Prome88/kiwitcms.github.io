Kiwi TCMS is the winner at OpenAwards'19 category Best Tech Community!
Big thanks to the jury, our contributors and core-team and the larger
open source and quality assurance communities who voted for us and supported
the project during all of those years.

This award is the best present we could get to mark the 10th anniversary
of the project. More news of how we are progressing with current roadmap will
follow soon in a separate blog post.

Thank you &amp; happy testing!
