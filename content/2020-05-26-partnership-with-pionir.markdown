We are happy to announce that Kiwi TCMS is going to partner with
[Pionir](https://pionir.org/) on the development of open source hardware
for testers!
Pionir is a free school focused on creating a new generation of digital leaders,
an exponential culture and solving challenges using technology. They are located
in Kikinda, Serbia.

This is not our first collaboration - the students are already
aware of the Kiwi TCMS project and last year they participated in
[presentation & workshop hosted by Alex]({filename}2019-08-09-autumn-conferences.markdown).
Zamphyr, the organization behind Pionir, is also one of the first open source projects
on our OSS program!


Black boxes for black-box testing
---------------------------------

Black-box testing is a method of software testing that examines the functionality
of the subject under test without peering into its internal structures or workings.
It is often performed by manipulating the possible inputs and examining the resulting
output. Experienced black-box testers often develop a hunch for where bugs my be
and it is not uncommon for them to discover some obscure problems nobody else thought
about. More often than not the basis for this is developing an understanding/expectation
how the SUT works by careful exploration during many iterations. Thus being able to
explore a SUT, observe its behavior, keep mental notes about possible relations
between input-behavior-output and analyzing what is happening under the hood becomes
an important skill for testers.

The idea for having something unknown to explore & train your skills first comes
from [James Lyndsay’s Black Box Puzzles](http://blackboxpuzzles.workroomprds.com/) and
was more recently implemented by
[Claudiu Draghia](http://blog.brainforit.com/2017/02/06/black-boxes-for-black-box-testing/).
Now it's our turn!


Project description
-------------------

Pionir will be developing hardware black boxes for teaching exploratory testing in
cooperation with Kiwi TCMS. We have dedicated
[€2000 from our bounty program](https://opencollective.com/kiwitcms/expenses/18960)
for students of the free school towards completing this project.

> The goal of the project is to produce at least 3 boxes and reference designs that will
> serve as a didactic tool for teaching, but also be free and open hardware, and as such,
> available to everyone to build from source.
>
> This project will be trusted to the students of the free school who will get opportunity
> to take part in the challenging process of building a digital appliance,
> from designing the machine logic, to develop and prototype hardware.

The project includes designing, assembling, programming, documenting and delivering this
hardware to us! Everything is expected to be open source: list of components,
assembly instructions, 3D design files, source code, documentation and instructions!
Our goal is that this will be relatively cheap and easy to build so everyone else
can build their own boxes.
During the next several months there will be new repositories created under
<https://github.com/kiwitcms> to host the various boxes.

The black boxes are expected to be available in October 2020 - just in time for the
upcoming conference season where members of the larger testing and open source
communities will be able to practice with them!



Call for sponsors
-----------------

We are also calling upon teams and organizations who use Kiwi TCMS in their
testing workflows. Please consider making a one-time donation or
becoming a regular sponsor via our
[Collective](https://opencollective.com/kiwitcms#section-contribute).
You can contribute as low as € 1! The entire budget will be distributed to the community!
