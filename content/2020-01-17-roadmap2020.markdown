Hello testers,
the Kiwi TCMS team sat down together last week and talked about what we feel
is important for us during the upcoming year. This blog post outlines our
roadmap for 2020!

Project sustainability
======================

The big goal towards which we are striving is to turn Kiwi TCMS into a
sustainable open source project. For now this means several key areas:

    1) Team
    2) Technical
    3) Community

Team
----

Right now we have a core team with 6 newcomers on-boarding.
Engineering performance is all over the place with some people contributing
too much while others contributing too little. More importantly there is no
consistent pace of contributions which makes planning timely completion of
technical tasks impossible.

At the moment we do operate as a bunch of disconnected people who happen to
talk to each other from time to time.

We are going to adjust our internal processes and how we on-board new members.
In fact we did our first "scrum-like" meeting this week and agreed to change
our existing practice and strive to become better as a team!

**Goal:** to have a cohesive team at the end of the year which operates with
a predictable capacity.

**Goal:** 1 PR/week/person as broad measure of individual performance.


Technical
---------

The areas shown on the picture above will receive more priority.

**Goal:** complete remaining [Telemetry features]({filename}2019-03-03-telemetry.markdown).

**Goal:** complete
[bug-tracker integration milestone](https://github.com/kiwitcms/Kiwi/milestone/1).

**Goal:** all pylint issues resolved.

**Goal:** migrate all remaining legacy templates to Patternfly UI. See
[patternfly-migration](https://github.com/kiwitcms/Kiwi/milestone/3) milestone.

**Goal:** where FE sends AJAX requests to BE views replace with JSON RPC API instead.

**Extra:** start tackling the JavaScript mess that we have. This depends and is related
to Patternfly migration and overall refactoring.

**Extra:** make it easier for downstream installations to extend and override parts
of Kiwi TCMS in order for users to adjust the system to their own needs.
The system is pretty flexible as-is but there have been requests,
both online and offline, to provide some extra features! We'll start looking
into them, likely making partial progress in the next 12 months.


Community
---------

Last year Kiwi TCMS had massive success at every single conference that we've been to.
Both project and team have been well received. While we are going to continue
being part of various communities around the world we are trying to limit
extensive travel and focus on functionality and partnerships which will
increase Kiwi TCMS eco-system, make the project even more popular and
drive further adoption!

**Goal:** extended GitHub integration via
[kiwitcms-github-app](https://github.com/kiwitcms/github-app/) plugin.

**Goal:** release the following
[test automation framework plugins](https://kiwitcms.readthedocs.io/en/latest/plugins/automation-frameworks.html)
for Kiwi TCMS:

- [PHPUnit plugin](https://github.com/kiwitcms/phpunit-plugin/)
- [py.test plugin](https://github.com/kiwitcms/pytest-plugin/)
- TestNG plugin
- Jenkins plugin
- Robot framework plugin
- Django plugin

For more information see
[test-automation-plugins](https://github.com/kiwitcms/Kiwi/milestone/2) milestone.

**Ongoing:** work with our partners from the proprietary and open source worlds.
This is hard to quantify and lots of it doesn't actually depend on the team.
However we are continuing to talk to them regularly. Expect new feedback to
become available under GitHub Issues.

**Extra:** see what we can do about testing productivity! This has always been
part of our mission but we have not been able to produce anything worth sharing.
We do have ideas in this space but we are generally looking for partnerships and collaborations.
It is very likely that there will not be very much progress on this front
because it is hard to define it properly :-(.


Summary
-------

At the end of the day most of these goals compliment each other and help drive all of
them to completion. Many of the still on-boarding people have expressed desire to
improve their Python & Django skills. Working to resolve issues in the above specific
areas will give them this opportunity! I expect they will show good progress on their respective
tasks so we can write more about them on this blog.


Happy testing!
