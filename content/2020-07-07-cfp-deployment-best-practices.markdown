Kiwi TCMS is opening a call for proposals: **Tell us how do you deploy, backup and upgrade
your Kiwi TCMS containers? What environment do you use, how do you migrate data
or ensure the system is always up and running? How do you go about testing if a
newer version doesn't break the features that you use ? What best practices have
you identified that can help others?**

We are going to collect your feedback and update the existing documentation.

Please submit your responses here:
<https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSe-kioT_e3UHwV5irwLroR2Jsk5oYM_Ls6acVeLVcBn7Kpt7Q/viewform>.
All fields are optional, including your email address!


Thank you and happy testing!
