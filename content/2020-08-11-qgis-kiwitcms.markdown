We are happy to announce that [QGIS](https://qgis.org) has chosen Kiwi TCMS
for the basis of their *Quality Assurance methodology and infrastructure*
improvement program!
Kiwi TCMS will play a central role in storing test case definitions,
organizing test cycles, and assigning and tracking test executions by testers
from the QGIS community.

The proposal
[QEP#180](https://github.com/qgis/QGIS-Enhancement-Proposals/issues/180) is the
highest voted proposal in the
[2020 QGIS Grant Program](http://blog.qgis.org/2020/07/10/qgis-grant-programme-2020-results/)
and has been awarded a budget of 5000â‚¬!
This grant will allow the proponents to spend significantly more time setting up the
infrastructure and planning a methodology for manual testing.



Scope of proposal
-----------------

[QEP#180](https://github.com/qgis/QGIS-Enhancement-Proposals/issues/180)
aims to create the necessary infrastructure and methodology to organize and
encourage systematic testing before each QGIS release:

- Setup a test management system to organize test cycles, assign and track tests execution;
- Elaborate and document a methodology to execute testing to help testers;
- Resurrect and move the tester plugin to QGIS repositories. Publish it in the QGIS official repository
- Create an initial set of relevant test cases;
- Organize and execute the initial test cases for the next releases.

This effort will steer members & volunteers of the QGIS community towards a more systematic
and organized testing during a feature freeze period before a release. The focus here
is on integration testing, manual & semi-automated workflows for important functionality
that should never regress and is hard or impossible to cover via unit tests.

The proposal is lead by Alexandre Neto, Giovanni Manghi and Alexander Bruy!

On behalf of the Kiwi TCMS community welcome aboard and happy testing!
