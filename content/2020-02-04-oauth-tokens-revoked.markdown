Hello testers as we've
[stated previously]({filename}2020-01-12-github-app-migration.markdown)
Kiwi TCMS has migrated to a new GitHub backend. The previous OAuth
application with ID `e45b09369720518e1fc3` has been deprecated.

OAuth tokens for this application have been revoked and you should have
received an email notification from GitHub about this.

If you still have an active Marketplace listing we kindly ask you to
cancel it until we're able to deploy the improved integration on
GitHub Marketplace again.


Thank you!
