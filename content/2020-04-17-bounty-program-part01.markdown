Kiwi TCMS is donating € 10000 (ten thousand euro) to our community to enable more hands working
together and give an opportunity for people to get exposed to open source
contributions. You will help us complete pending tasks faster while
learning something new and receive a bonus for your efforts!
This blog post outlines the rules of our open source bounty program.


Who is eligible to participate
------------------------------

Everyone who meets the following criteria is eligible to participate:

- Has an account on <https://opencollective.com> - needed to follow program updates
  and request payments
- Has a bank account - needed for actual money transfer, more info below!

If you are beginner in Python, Django or some other technology that we use
please consider available documentation, your local user group, developers forum and
StackOverflow to get help. Do not turn GitHub issues into a
"getting started in programming" discussion.


Engagement rules
----------------

- Program will be split into multiple rounds as we work to clearly define
  what needs to be done and adjust priorities
- News and updates will be posted at <https://opencollective.com/kiwitcms/updates/>
- You are expected to mostly work alone on issues
- Technical discussion will be happening via GitHub pull requests and/or GitHub issues
  under <https://github.com/kiwitcms/Kiwi> unless indicated otherwise
- Translation related discussion will be happening via Crowdin under
  <https://crowdin.com/project/kiwitcms/discussions> when needed
- Do not contact individual team members privately, we are going to ignore such messages


FIFO order for code review
--------------------------

- Contributions will be reviewed and merged in a rolling *first-in-first-out* order,
  that is we review 1 PR and while waiting for updates continue on the next in the queue
- In case of collisions, multiple contributions that try to resolve the same problem,
  our team will review the first one, then the second one, etc. The pull request
  which is first to pass DoD and code review will be merged and the conflicting ones closed
- Please comment on issues and work together with other community members to
  split the work and avoid collisions as much as possible


About issues
------------

Our team will try to clearly describe each task and what constitutes a
successfully completed task, e.g. *definition of done* (DoD). If this isn't the case
please ask questions and seek clarification about such tasks.

- Only Issues under the [bounty-program milestone](https://github.com/kiwitcms/Kiwi/milestone/4)
  **AND** labelled with a specific monetary amount are eligible for payout!
- Unlabelled issues need further refinement before they can be accepted for bounties!

Payout rules
------------

Once DoD has been met and the contribution is merged you may claim the assigned bounty.
You must perform the following steps:

- [Submit an expense](https://opencollective.com/kiwitcms/expenses/new) to the
  Kiwi TCMS Collective
- All expenses submitted to the Kiwi TCMS Collective must follow the invoicing rules
  of our Fiscal Host.
  [Here is an invoice template (Google Doc)](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1-unqsnko4Eaza3fSuVAUFqvhMwe-h1V8jhruTDBjrUY/copy)
  you can use. Fill-in the blue parts and leave the black parts
- Invoice & expense description contains the number of issue(s) and PR(s) for which
  bounty is claimed

**Identity cross validation:**

Once an expense has been submitted add a comment with your GitHub/Crowdin username
to it + open a
[new issue in GitHub](https://github.com/kiwitcms/Kiwi/issues/new?assignees=atodorov&labels=&template=claim_bounty.md&title=)
/new discussion in Crowdin with link to
the expense submission. This will help us cross-validate that we are talking
to the same person between platforms.


**Note on bank transfers**

A message from our [Fiscal Host](https://opencollective.com/europe):

> We currently prefer to do payouts using bank transfers.
> We used to support PayPal but fees were way too high for the collectives.
>
> About bank transfer, we do EU transfers as well as non EU (which takes more time obviously).
>
> We noticed that several collectives are now using Revolut bank accounts which is the
> easiest and cheapest way (it’s free) to receive money anywhere in the world.


It looks like the fastest & cheapest way to get paid is via Revolut account if you have one,
followed by standard bank transfer and PayPal account is last!
