Kiwi TCMS website
-----------------

This website is built with Pelican, https://blog.getpelican.com/.
To start hacking you need:

- make, preferably GNU Make. See https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Make_(software),
  https://www.gnu.org/software/make/ and your Linux distribution
- Python 3.6 or later, see https://www.python.org/downloads/
- git client, see https://git-scm.com/downloads or https://desktop.github.com/
- fork this repository, see https://help.github.com/en/github/getting-started-with-github/fork-a-repo
- `git clone` your fork, see ^^^
- create a virtual environment with `venv`, see https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html
- activate the virtual environment created above (`<venv>/bin/activate`)
- `cd kiwitcms.github.io/`
- `pip install -r requirements.txt`
- `git checkout source` to switch to the `source` branch
- `git checkout -b name_of_your_branch`

In 2 separate terminals use:

- `make regenerate` to regenerate the website with latest changes
- `make serve` to serve them at http://localhost:8000/ for preview

Edit files to make changes in the website. You are most likely looking
for files in `content/pages/`!

Once you are ready:

- `git commit` you changes
- `git push origin name_of_your_branch`
- open a pull request against the `source` branch!
